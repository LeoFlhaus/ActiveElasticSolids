# ActiveElasticSolids
This repository contains the simulation and data analysis code used in my Master's thesis


- The simulation code is divided for a flat surface and a spherical surface.
- In each case, an isotropic network of springs is created in the initialization folder
- The corresponding Delauney triangulation is calculated in the python script VoronoiDelauney.py
- Afterwards, the simulation can be performed in the simulation folder and essential functions for the data analysis are attached in DataAnalysis.py
